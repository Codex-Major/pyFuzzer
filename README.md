# pyFuzzer
Web directory FUZZer written in python.
Kinda slow, which reminds me that I need to get learnt up on threading.

# Usage:
    pyFuzzer [-h] [-u URL] [-w WORDLIST]

optional arguments:

    -h, --help   show this help message and exit
  
    -u URL       URL of the site to fuzz
  
    -w WORDLIST  Path to desired wordlist

Thank you for checking out my tool!
